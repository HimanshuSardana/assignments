### By Prabhpreet Singh

### Question 1
**A class with 10 students wants to produce some information from the results of the four standard tests in Maths, Science, English and IT> Each test is out of 100 marks. The information output should be the highest lowest and average marks for each test and the highest, lowest and average mark overall. Write a program in python to complete this task.** 

```python
n = 10
marks = {
    "Maths": [],
    "Science": [],
    "English": [],
    "IT": []
}

for i in range(n):
    marks["Maths"].append(int(input(f"Enter Maths marks for student {i+1}: ")))
    marks["Science"].append(int(input(f"Enter Science marks for student {i+1}: ")))
    marks["English"].append(int(input(f"Enter English marks for student {i+1}: ")))
    marks["IT"].append(int(input(f"Enter IT marks for student {i+1}: ")))

highest = {
    "Maths": max(marks["Maths"]),
    "Science": max(marks["Science"]),
    "English": max(marks["English"]),
    "IT": max(marks["IT"]),
    "Overall": max(max(marks["Maths"]), max(marks["Science"]), max(marks["English"]), max(marks["IT"]))
}

lowest = {
    "Maths": min(marks["Maths"]),
    "Science": min(marks["Science"]),
    "English": min(marks["English"]),
    "IT": min(marks["IT"]),
    "Overall": min(min(marks["Maths"]), min(marks["Science"]), min(marks["English"]), min(marks["IT"]))
}

average = {
    "Maths": sum(marks["Maths"]) / n,
    "Science": sum(marks["Science"]) / n,
    "English": sum(marks["English"]) / n,
    "IT": sum(marks["IT"]) / n,
    "Overall": (sum(marks["Maths"]) + sum(marks["Science"]) + sum(marks["English"]) + sum(marks["IT"])) / (n * 4)
}

print("Highest Marks:")
for key, value in highest.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

print("\nLowest Marks:")
for key, value in lowest.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

print("\nAverage Marks:")
for key, value in average.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

### Question 2
**Write a python program to input basic salary of an employee and calculate its Gross salary according to following:**
- Basic Salary <= 10000 : HRA = 20%, DA = 80%
- Basic Salary <= 20000 : HRA = 25%, DA = 90%
- Basic Salary > 20000 : HRA = 30%, DA = 95%

```python
basic_salary = int(input("Enter basic salary: "))
hra = 0
da = 0

if basic_salary <= 10000:
    hra = 0.2 * basic_salary
    da = 0.8 * basic_salary
elif basic_salary <= 20000:
    hra = 0.25 * basic_salary
    da = 0.9 * basic_salary
else:
    hra = 0.3 * basic_salary
    da = 0.95 * basic_salary

gross_salary = basic_salary + hra + da
print(f"Gross Salary: {gross_salary}")
```

### Question 3
**Write a Python program to check the validity of password input by users** 
- At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z]
- At least 1 number between [0-9]
- At least 1 character from [$#@]
- Minimum length 6 characters
- Maximum length 16 characters

```python
password = input("Enter password: ")

if len(password) < 6 or len(password) > 16:
    print("Password length should be between 6 and 16 characters")
else:
    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least 1 lowercase letter")
    elif not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least 1 uppercase letter")
    elif not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least 1 digit")
    elif not any(char in "$#@!" for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least 1 special character ($#@!)")
    else:
        isValid = True

if isValid:
    print("Password is valid")
```

### Question 4
**Create a list L that is defined as `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]`**
- WAP to add 200 and 300 to L
- WAP to remove 10 and 30 from L
- WAP to sort L in ascending order
- WAP to sort L in descending order

```python
L = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
L.append(200)
L.append(300)

L.remove(10)
L.remove(30)

L.sort()
print(L)

L.sort(reverse=True)
print(L)
```

### Question 5
**D is a dictionary defined as `D = {1: "One", 2: "Two", 3: "Three", 4: "Four", 5: "Five"}`** 
- WAP to add 6: "Six" to D
- WAP to remove 2: "Two" from D
- WAP to check if 6 key is present in D
- WAP to count the number of elements in D
- WAP to add all the values in D

```python
D = {1: "One", 2: "Two", 3: "Three", 4: "Four", 5: "Five"}

D[6] = "Six"

del D[2]

if 6 in D:
    print("Key 6 is present in D")
else:
    print("Key 6 is not present in D")

print(f"Number of elements in D: {len(D)}")

print(f"Sum of all values in D: {sum(D.keys())}")
```

### Question 6
**WAP to create a list of 100 random numbers between 100 and 900. Count and print the** 
- All Odd numbers
- All Even numbers
- All Prime numbers

```python
import random

numbers = [random.randint(100, 900) for i in range(100)]

odd = 0
for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 != 0:
        odd += 1

even = 0
for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        even += 1

prime = 0

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

for number in numbers:
    if is_prime(number):
        prime += 1

print(f"Odd numbers: {odd}")
print(f"Even numbers: {even}")
print(f"Prime numbers: {prime}")
```

### Question 7
- **Write a function which takes principal amount, interest rate and amount and returns the compound interest. Call this function to print your output.** 
- **Save this function as a module in a python file and call it in another python file.** 


*file_1.py*
```python
def compound_interest(principal, rate, time):
    return principal * (1 + rate / 100) ** time - principal
```

*file_2.py*
```python
import file_1

principal = 1000
rate = 5
time = 2

print(file_1.compound_interest(principal, rate, time))
```

### Question 8
- **Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type. Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating the restaurant is open. Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the 2 attributes individually and then call both methods.** 
- **Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the user's information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user. Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods for each user.** 

```python
class Restaurant:
    def __init__(self, restaurant_name, cuisine_type):
        self.restaurant_name = restaurant_name
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        print(f"Restaurant Name: {self.restaurant_name}")
        print(f"Cuisine Type: {self.cuisine_type}")

    def open_restaurant(self):
        print(f"{self.restaurant_name} is open")

restaurant = Restaurant("Pizza Hut", "Italian")
print(restaurant.restaurant_name)
print(restaurant.cuisine_type)

restaurant.describe_restaurant()
restaurant.open_restaurant()
```

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name

    def describe_user(self):
        print(f"First Name: {self.first_name}")
        print(f"Last Name: {self.last_name}")

    def greet_user(self):
        print(f"Hello, {self.first_name} {self.last_name}")

user1 = User("John", "Doe")
user2 = User("Jane", "Doe")

user1.describe_user()
user1.greet_user()

user2.describe_user()
user2.greet_user()
```
