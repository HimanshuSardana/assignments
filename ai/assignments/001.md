### Question 1
**A class with 10 students wants to produce some information from the results of the four standard tests in Maths, Science, English and IT> Each test is out of 100 marks. The information output should be the highest lowest and average marks for each test and the highest, lowest and average mark overall. Write a program in python to complete this task.** 

```python
n = 10
marks = {
    "Maths": [],
    "Science": [],
    "English": [],
    "IT": []
}

for i in range(n):
    marks["Maths"].append(int(input(f"Enter Maths marks for student {i+1}: ")))
    marks["Science"].append(int(input(f"Enter Science marks for student {i+1}: ")))
    marks["English"].append(int(input(f"Enter English marks for student {i+1}: ")))
    marks["IT"].append(int(input(f"Enter IT marks for student {i+1}: ")))

highest = {
    "Maths": max(marks["Maths"]),
    "Science": max(marks["Science"]),
    "English": max(marks["English"]),
    "IT": max(marks["IT"]),
    "Overall": max(max(marks["Maths"]), max(marks["Science"]), max(marks["English"]), max(marks["IT"]))
}

lowest = {
    "Maths": min(marks["Maths"]),
    "Science": min(marks["Science"]),
    "English": min(marks["English"]),
    "IT": min(marks["IT"]),
    "Overall": min(min(marks["Maths"]), min(marks["Science"]), min(marks["English"]), min(marks["IT"]))
}

average = {
    "Maths": sum(marks["Maths"]) / n,
    "Science": sum(marks["Science"]) / n,
    "English": sum(marks["English"]) / n,
    "IT": sum(marks["IT"]) / n,
    "Overall": (sum(marks["Maths"]) + sum(marks["Science"]) + sum(marks["English"]) + sum(marks["IT"])) / (n * 4)
}

print("Highest Marks:")
for key, value in highest.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

print("\nLowest Marks:")
for key, value in lowest.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

print("\nAverage Marks:")
for key, value in average.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

### Question 2
**Write a python program to input basic salary of an employee and calculate its Gross salary according to following:**
- Basic Salary <= 10000 : HRA = 20%, DA = 80%
- Basic Salary <= 20000 : HRA = 25%, DA = 90%
- Basic Salary > 20000 : HRA = 30%, DA = 95%

```python
basic_salary = int(input("Enter basic salary: "))
hra = 0
da = 0

if basic_salary <= 10000:
    hra = 0.2 * basic_salary
    da = 0.8 * basic_salary
elif basic_salary <= 20000:
    hra = 0.25 * basic_salary
    da = 0.9 * basic_salary
else:
    hra = 0.3 * basic_salary
    da = 0.95 * basic_salary

gross_salary = basic_salary + hra + da
print(f"Gross Salary: {gross_salary}")
```

### Question 3
**Write a Python program to check the validity of password input by users** 
- At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z]
- At least 1 number between [0-9]
- At least 1 character from [$#@]
- Minimum length 6 characters
- Maximum length 16 characters

```python
password = input("Enter password: ")

if len(password) < 6 or len(password) > 16:
    print("Password length should be between 6 and 16 characters")
else:
    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least 1 lowercase letter")
    elif not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least 1 uppercase letter")
    elif not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least 1 digit")
    elif not any(char in "$#@!" for char in password):
        print("Password should contain at least 1 special character ($#@!)")
    else:
        isValid = True

if isValid:
    print("Password is valid")
```

### Question 4
**Create a list L that is defined as `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]`**
- WAP to add 200 and 300 to L
- WAP to remove 10 and 30 from L
- WAP to sort L in ascending order
- WAP to sort L in descending order

```python
L = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
L.append(200)
L.append(300)

L.remove(10)
L.remove(30)

L.sort()
print(L)

L.sort(reverse=True)
print(L)
```
